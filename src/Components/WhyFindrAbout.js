            learning from you too. A partner is someone who complements your needs. Yeah, it sounds
            a lot like a date doesn’t it? Well, that’s because it is. When you work on a project, you don’t look
            for someone who has the same skillset as you! We recognise this and part of the reason we are
            able to do that is because we are students too!</div>

            to match you with such people and help you find that ‘perfect someone’.</div>
